# Interpreter Pattern
## Problem-solving:
Use the Interpreter Pattern to build an interpreter for a language.

• **_AbstractExpression_**
- declares an abstract Interpret operation that is common to all nodes in the abstract syntax tree.

• **_TerminalExpression_**
- implements an Interpret operation associated with terminal symbols in the
grammar.
- an instance is required for every terminal symbol in a sentence.
  
• **_NonterminalExpression_**
- one such class is required for every rule `R::=R1R2...Rn` in the grammar.
- maintains instance variables of type AbstractExpression for each of the symbols RI through Rn.
- implements an Interpret operation for nonterminal symbols in the grammar. Interpret typically calls itself recursively on the variables representing R1 through Rn.
  
• **_Context_**
- contains information that's global to the interpreter.
  
• **_Client_**
- builds (or is given) an abstract syntax tree representing a particular sentence in the language that the grammar defines. The abstract syntax tree is assembled from instances of the NonterminalExpression and TerminalExpression classes.
- invokes the Interpret operation.

## Benefits:
- Representing each grammar rule in a class makes the language easy to implement.

- Because the grammar is represented by classes, you can easily change or extend the language.

- By adding additional methods to the class structure, you can add new behaviors beyond interpretation, like pretty printing and more sophisticated program validation.

## Uses and Drawback:
- Use interpreter when you need to implement a simple language.

- Appropriate when you have a simple grammar and simplicity is more important than efficiency.

- Used for scripting and programming languages.

- This pattern can become cumbersome when the number of grammar rules is large. In these cases a parser/compiler generator may be more appropriate.
