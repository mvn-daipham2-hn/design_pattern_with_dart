> **Objectville** is a term from the book "Head First Design Patterns" by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates, a popular guide to design patterns in object-oriented programming.
> 
> In the book, Objectville humorously represents the world of OOP as a "city" where objects live, interact, and follow design principles and patterns. Each object has a specific responsibility, communicates through methods, and adheres to good design practices.

# Design Principles:
1. Encapsulate what varies.
    - [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/strategy_pattern/README.md#design-principles)
    - [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/observer_pattern/README.md#design-principles)   
2. Favor composition over inheritance
   - [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/strategy_pattern/README.md#design-principles)
   - [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/observer_pattern/README.md#design-principles)
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations.
   - [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/strategy_pattern/README.md#design-principles)
   - [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/observer_pattern/README.md#design-principles)
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
   - [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/observer_pattern/README.md#design-principles)
5. **Open-Closed principle**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - [Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/decorator_pattern/README.md#design-principles)
6. **The Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
    - [Factory Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/factory_pattern/README.md#design-principles)   
7. **Principle of Least Knowledge** - talk only to your immediate friends. It is also called the **Law of Demeter**
    - [Facade Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/adapter_and_facade_patterns/README.md#design-principles)
8. **The Hollywood Principle**: Don’t call us, we’ll call you.
    - [Template Method Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/template_method_pattern/README.md#design-principles)
9. **Single Responsibility**: A class should have only one reason to change.
    - [Iterator Pattern](https://github.com/mvn-daipham2-hn/design_pattern_with_dart/blob/main/iterator_and_composite_patterns/README.md#design-principles)
