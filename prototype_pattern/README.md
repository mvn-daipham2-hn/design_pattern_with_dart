# Prototype Pattern
## Problem-solving:
Use the Prototype Pattern when creating an instance of a given class is either expensive or complicated.

## UML diagram:

## Benefits:
- Hides the complexities of making new instances from the client.

- Provides the option for the client to generate objects whose type is not known.

- In some circumstances, copying an object can be more efficient than creating a new object.

## Uses and Drawback:
- Prototype should be considered when a system must create new objects of many types in a complex class hierarchy.

- A drawback to using the Prototype is that making a copy of an object can sometimes be complicated.
